see-again choices.

Option 1:

{
    "see-again-choices": {

        "users": {
            
            "user1": {
                "no": 12,
                "maybe-no": 1,
                "maybe-yes": 10,
                "yes": 4
            },

            "user2": {
                "no": 2,
                "maybe-no": 5,
                "maybe-yes": 7,
                "yes": 13
            },    

            "user3": { "no": 8, "maybe-no": 6, "maybe-yes": 3, "yes": 1},
